vermeer-backend
===============

To run clone the project to your computer.

- git clone git@github.com:SE-1402/vermeer-backend.git

When you first 'cd' into the directory you'll be asked to initialize the 'virtual environment'.

This creates a directory at ~/.virtualenv/vermeer/, and all the dependencies for the project will be installed here.

To run the server:
- python server.py

To debug:
- python server.py debug

(You can also download intellij, or pycharm community editions to debug the server if neccessary.)

Credit goes to Autobahn|Python for the server implementation:
